Dataset (http://vrai.dii.univpm.it/re-id-dataset)

Person re-identification is an important topic in scene monitoring, human computer interaction, retail, people counting, ambient assisted living and many other computer vision research.
The TVPR dataset stores depth frames (640x480) collected using Asus Xtion Pro Live in top-view configuration. This setup choice is primarily due to the reduction of occlusion and it has also the advantage of being privacy preserving, because faces are not recorded by the camera. The use of an RGB-D camera allow to extract anthropometric features for the recognition of people passing under the camera.
